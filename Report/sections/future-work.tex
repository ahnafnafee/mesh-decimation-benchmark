\section{Future Work}

Two directions warrant further investigation. First, \textbf{texture preservation}: production meshes are often UV-mapped, and Vertex Clustering's global quantization can cause severe texture distortion. Incorporating UV deviation metrics would reveal whether QEM's iterative approach better preserves attribute interpolation. Second, \textbf{hybrid pipelines}: a content-aware system could analyze input mesh density and curvature to route CAD models to Clustering and organic scans to QEM automatically. With the rise of neural geometry processing, comparing these classical methods against learned simplification networks represents a promising extension.
